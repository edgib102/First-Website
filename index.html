    <h3>Hey! This is a website I created for practicing my web skills, I'm doing this for a future utility in an upcoming project, but that's not important right now.
         <br> What's important is that you clicked on this website, and took time out of your day to read this! If you're still reading, you're a real one, seriously. <br><br> Cheers, Eden </h3>
