                this is NOT DESIGNED FOR MOBILE. It's recommended 110% that you take a look on your pc.
                This is a stage where you're taking a look at a mockup of the actual final content, so the stuff you see
                wasn't actually suggested by anyone, it was just me having fun (: <br><br>Apart from that, I just wanna
                say thank you for taking to time to look at this! It makes all the time I spent worth it in the end.

                    Hey! I'm Eden, a 16-year-old 3d artist from New Zealand, who loves to think up and implement new ideas and concepts. This is something I've only discovered recently, and it's mainly due to the NFT space that I've realised this.<br><br>
                    I created my Twitter account after wanting to post my work when I was still a beginner, and then I saw quite a few artists that I look up to showing interest and from there it snowballed. Fast forward to the present, it's been the biggest change in my life so far. I've discovered so many new traits and quirks about me and have developed as a person immensely.<br><br>
                    Apart from that, I enjoy a little coding, music, electrical engineering, video production and photography. But there's almost nothing I'm not interested in, to a degree!

                    Closing off, I just wanted to say a few final things. First off, HUGE thanks to @exploringni8sky. He's been super helpful in mentoring me with the website and doing some work on it, as I literally learnt how to code websites for this! Huge props to him, make sure you go check him out.<br><br>
                    Another thanks goes to @PAPERDIAMOND for baring with my questions at the start, he definitely was a guiding light on where I should look first to get started with developing this. Along with that, huge thanks to the people who tested and gave feedback on this website! Some notable people: @Creative_h0bby for the continued feedback, xx, xx, and everyone else who helped!<br><br>
                    Finally, I want to thank YOU! Thank you for reading this far, thank you for being interested in me and my little projects, and thank you for just showing up, I seriously appreciate it. Enjoy the community project!
