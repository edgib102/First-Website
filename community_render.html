            <p class="raleway-Low-Dark">Before you check out this website, I just wanted to say a few things. Firstly,
                this is NOT DESIGNED FOR MOBILE. It's recommended 110% that you take a look on your pc.
                This is a stage where you're taking a look at a mockup of the actual final content, so the stuff you see
                wasn't actually suggested by anyone, it was just me having fun (: <br><br>Apart from that, I just wanna
                say thank you for taking to time to look at this! It makes all the time I spent worth it in the end.

                                    crew hosted, he pushed for the sale of my collection like no other, and helped make it

                <p class="raleway-Low-Light">
                    Hey! I'm Eden, a 16-year-old 3d artist from New Zealand, who loves to think up and implement new ideas and concepts. This is something I've only discovered recently, and it's mainly due to the NFT space that I've realised this.<br><br>
                    I created my Twitter account after wanting to post my work when I was still a beginner, and then I saw quite a few artists that I look up to showing interest and from there it snowballed. Fast forward to the present, it's been the biggest change in my life so far. I've discovered so many new traits and quirks about me and have developed as a person immensely.<br><br>
                    Apart from that, I enjoy a little coding, music, electrical engineering, video production and photography. But there's almost nothing I'm not interested in, to a degree!
